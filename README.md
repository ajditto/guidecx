# README

## Getting Started

This is my takehome submission for GuideCX by Andrew Ditto

[cypress docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress)

### Clone Repo
```
git clone https://github.com/ajditto/guidecx.git
```

### Install Libraries
```
cd gcx_homework
yarn install
```

### Running Cypress GUI
To run Cypress, type the following:

```
yarn cypress open
```

### Running the tests
To run the tests, you can run via Cypress GUI or CLI

```
yarn cypress run --headless
```

The tests will run in a headless browser and output results to the terminal. This will indicate what current tests are passing and ones that need to be fixed. You're now ready to start!


Thank You!
